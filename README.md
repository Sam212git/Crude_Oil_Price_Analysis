Influenced by global/regional tesions, demand, supply and other factors, crude oil prices have seen a series of ups and downs.
This project is an analysis of the history of crude oil prices starting from the year 2000.

Data was downloaded from kaggle
then inspetion was done using excel
data visualisation/storytelling was also carried out, an interactive dashboard was also created
all using tableau.
finally a model was trained on the prepared data to make predictions of closing crude prices.

Even though the variables in the dataset used in this project perform quite well when used in a ML algorithm in predicting closing crude prices, it is also necessary to mention that for a 
better undestanting of the factors that affect crude oil prices, or to better predict future prices of crude oil, more data/variable have to be considered such as supply, demand, global events and so on.
